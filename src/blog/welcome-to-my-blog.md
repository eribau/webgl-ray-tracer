This is my first entry on this blog. Yay! I'll be trying to write down notes here on my development of a ray tracer in WebGL for the course 'Computer graphics and interactions' at KTH. I've set this site up so that you can see the current state of the project on the front page and read about it in this blog.

Currently the canvas on the front page is only rendering a black screen, but the next step is to start rendering something a little more interesting.
