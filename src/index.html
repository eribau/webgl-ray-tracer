title: WebGL Ray Tracer
---

<p> This is an implementation of a ray tracer as described in Peter Shirley's excellent book <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">"Ray Tracing in One Weekend"</a>, but coded in WebGL.</p>
<p>If you are viewing this on a desktop you can interact with the scene by dragging on the image to rotate the camera around and scroll to zoom in and out. </p>
