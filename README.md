# Ray Tracer in WebGL

This is an implementation of the ray tracer described in Peter Shirley's book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). You can try it live [here](https://eribau.github.io/webgl-ray-tracer/).

The ray tracer is interactive and you can rotate the camera by clicking and dragging on the image using the mouse and zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel (does not work on mobile).

## Running it locally

You need to first have Node.js and npm (Node packet manager) installed in order to run the program. Instructions for installing them can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install).

Once you have them installed, open a terminal and go to the root folder of this project. Install all the required dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

Start a local instance of the project by running

```
npm start
```

The project should now be available from https://localhost:8080
